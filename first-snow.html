        <p>
            I'm so happy I have my momma!<br>
            It is so cold and wet outside! I don't know what to do about it! <br>
            Momma said it should be the last snow. I hope so! If I <em>never</em> see this snow stuff again, it will be <em>too soon</em>! <br> The other doggies in the neighborhood seem to really enjoy it. I can hear them playing as Momma is carrying me in her arms. She bundled me up in her sweater, so I'm nice and warm. I never want to leave the sweater! <br>
            There were some areas where the snow wasn't very deep. That was pretty nice actually. I could see Momma and the house! The rest of world was cut off by snow walls though. <br>
            Maybe when I'm bigger I'll like snow, but for now I just want it to go away!
