        <h2> About Me </h2>
        
        <p> 
            I was born sometime in December, but my momma likes to use my <strong>gotcha day</strong>, <em>February 14, 2014</em>, as my birthday. She calls me a choofacabra, but my mother is a <em>pit-bull</em> and <em>boxer</em> mix, and my dad is a <em>rottweiler</em> and <em>shar-pei</em> mix.

            I hope you enjoy learning about me!
